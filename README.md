## Creating Your Own

Simply ask Claude to create any diagram or visualization:

```
"Create an AWS architecture diagram with load balancers, Lambda, and RDS"
```

```
"Design a flowchart showing user authentication flow"
```

```
"Make a network topology diagram for my data center"
```

```
"Create a beautiful LinkedIn banner for a DevOps engineer"
```

Claude will generate a high-quality diagram and save it with a descriptive name.

## Getting Started with Claude Code

## Tips for Best Results

- **Be specific** - "AWS diagram with API Gateway, Lambda, and DynamoDB in separate VPC subnets"
- **Mention the purpose** - "for a presentation" or "for documentation"
- **Request styles** - "Make it minimal" or "Use blue and green colors"
- **Specify type** - "architecture diagram", "flowchart", "network topology"

### Talk to Claude Like a Designer

Claude can handle specific design instructions just like you'd give to a human designer:

- "Move the Lambda function 2 inches to the right"
- "Make the database icon 50% larger"
- "Add more space between the load balancer and the servers"
- "Move the title down a bit, it's too close to the edge"
- "The connection lines are overlapping, route them around the services"
- "Make the AWS logo smaller and put it in the corner"
- "The text is hard to read, make it white with a dark background"

Don't hesitate to iterate - Claude will remember the context and make precise adjustments!

## Troubleshooting

**Claude not creating diagrams?**
- Make sure you're using Claude Code (not regular Claude)
- Mention "diagram" or "visualization" in your request

**Need different formats?**
- Open the generated HTML file in a browser
- Use the export controls for PNG/JPEG/WebP

**Want to modify?**
- Ask Claude to update: "Make the boxes larger" or "Change to dark theme"
